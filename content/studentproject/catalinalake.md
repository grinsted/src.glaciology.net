Catalina lake is a gigantic glacier dammed lake on the Renland peninsula, in the Scoresbysund region in East-Greenland. Every 1-2 decades it breaks through the glacier dam and a very large volume of fresh water is flushed into the fjord.

In this project you will study the consequences of the large GLOF. There are many potential subprojects within this headline. 

* You can model the impact on the fjord circulation (with Markus as a supervisor). 
* You can study the elastic rebound from the uplift using InSAR techiques on sentinel-1 or by using models. (Maybe with help from DTU-Space)
* You can try to measure and model the impact on the flow of Edward Bailey glacier.

This study will build on
* This satalina [see this study](/publication/2017-09-06-catalina-lake/)
* Some of these products: Sentinel-1/2, InSAR, Fjord model, glacier model.
