Firn densification is the process by which snow transforms into glacial ice. Snow accumulates and compresses over time, causing the snowflakes to compact and recrystallize. Initially, the snow is light and fluffy, but as more snow accumulates on top, the weight compresses the lower layers, increasing their density. This process continues as the snow is buried deeper, and the air pockets between the snowflakes are squeezed out, turning the snow into firn, which is a granular, intermediate stage between snow and glacial ice.

In this project you would work towards improving our models of the densification process. How well does firn support stresses, how fast does it compress, and how does it respond to temperature change?

Why? We need to know the density if we are to convert elevation change measured from satelite to a change in mass and so it is important for sea level studies. The densification process is also important for interpreting gas records from ice cores.
