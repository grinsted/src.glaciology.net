Sea level rise will become a huge challenge for coastal societies around the world. We need good data, we need good models, and we need to understand all changes.

We can model the gravitational effect the moon nodal cycle has on the tides quite well. However, recent model studies suggest that the nodal cycle has an impact on diapycnal mixing in the ocean, and therefore ocean heat content. This ultimately implies that the nodal signal in sea level at the coast will not be in-phase with the gravitational effect. This is a major issue because this low frequency nodal signal can be mistaken for a anthropogenic signal. It is unclear how to best address this issue in practise. This is where you can help...
