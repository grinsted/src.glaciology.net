The ice sheets are vast and direct observations of many processes are sparse. How can we apply ML techniques to remote sensing data to fill gaps.

The potential targets of your study could be some of these key variables:
* Accumulation (a current focus of a big project at PICE)
* Surface Mass Balance
* Temperatures
* Albedo
* Firn pack variables

A particular challenge when working with ice sheets will be the sparse ground truth data.
