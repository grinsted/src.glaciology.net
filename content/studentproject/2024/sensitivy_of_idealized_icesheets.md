How does model choices influence the ice sheet sensitivity? 

<!-- more -->

Often ice sheet models are tuned to closely simulate the present day state. However, sometimes this is achieved using crude unphysical means. My intuition tells me that this potentially can lead to a huge bias in sea level projections. 

In this project you will aim to understand how some of these arbitrary choices influence the model response in idealized setups. 

If you are interested in this project, then come and discuss the details with me. 

Keywords to remind myself what i am thinking of: spin_up/inversion/ocean_kill/fabric.
