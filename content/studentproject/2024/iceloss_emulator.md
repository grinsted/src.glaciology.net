Realistic ice sheet models are computationally expensive to run. This is a challenge if we want to characterize the full uncertainty for sea level projections.

The task is to design an ice sheet model 'emulator' that can be trained on a limited set of model runs and then used to predict how the ice model would respond to different forcing projections.
