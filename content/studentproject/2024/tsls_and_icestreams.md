Ice streams can display oscillatory and even chaotic behaviour. How does the state of ice streams influence the predictability of the ice sheet response to anthropogenic forcing?

There are multiple approaches to this topic, and so there is some flexibility if you would like to go in this direction. It can be approached using conceptual models like Robel's ice stream oscillator, or full fledged ice sheet models such as PISM.
