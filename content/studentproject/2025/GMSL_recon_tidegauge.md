Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) is a key climate record. In addition to a 

It is directly relevant to coastal communities.

<!--more-->

The GMSL record over the 20th century is based on sparse tide gauge records, and rely on various statistical techniques to extrapolate to the global ocean. There will be some uncertainty associated with the extrapolation. Can you do it better than existing techniques. 

In this study you will design a new GMSL reconstruction method, and put it to the test. Can you improve our estimates of historical sea level with your new statistical method? 

Can we injest discontinous data such as  

Outcomes: 
* A new reconstruction method
* A new GMSL record
* Improved uncertainties 

Brainstorm:
* Spherical harmonics
* GAMs
