This summer I've been doing fieldwork at [Eastgrip](http://eastgrip.org/), doing a GPS survey of a stake strain network, and mapping the surroundings with a fixed wing drone. But I also found some time to compose a track in the evenings. Here it is:

I used some samples from life in the camp:

* [Moving the winch (Sverrir, Steff, and Trevor)](http://eastgrip.org/field-diaries-folder/uk-diaries-2016/2016-08-02/) (sounds of chains etc)
* Olivier teaching Nik some french.
* [Bo hammering an allen key while assembling a Viesmann cabin](http://eastgrip.org/field-diaries-folder/uk-diaries-2016/2016-08-04/)

Me singing these lyrics:

> - we're drilling ice -
> - we're drilling ice -
> - and we're not gonna stop -
> - we're not gonna stop until we reach the bedrock -
