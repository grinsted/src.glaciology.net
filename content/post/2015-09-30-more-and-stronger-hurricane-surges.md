I thought I would share this quite illustration on how to interpret changes in return period/return magnitude plots.
  
[Data]({{< ref "publication/2013-10-11-homogeneous-record-of-atlantic-hurricane-surge-threat-since-1923.md" >}}) on hurricane surges along the US Atlantic and gulf coasts indicate that [more and stronger hurricane activity in globally warm years]({{< ref "publication/2013-10-11-homogeneous-record-of-atlantic-hurricane-surge-threat-since-1923.md" >}}).

Our [statistical model](/Home/PDFs/Announcements/projectedatlantichurricanesurgethreatfromrisingtemperatures) used for projection of hurricane surge threat also finds this relationship.
  
Note: that if you focus only on the most rare, and most intense events then you will not be able to tell the difference between "more intense" and "more frequent".
  
# <Consensus?
  
There is a consensus on "stronger" hurricanes in a warmer world, but not a consensus on "more" (see e.g. discussion [here](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/study-projects-more-frequent-and-stronger-hurricanes-worldwide-16204)). It should be noted that fewer but stronger hurricanes, is not necessarily incompatible with more and stronger hurricane surges.
