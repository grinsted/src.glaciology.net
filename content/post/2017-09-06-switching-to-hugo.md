This site is now created using a static site generator called [hugo](https://gohugo.io). I host it on a [netlify](https://netlify.com), and the source files are hosted on github. This is a nice setup for academics. So thumbs up from me.

I've previously hosted my site on google sites which was nice because it has zero maintenance, but also almost no flexibility. I migrated to wordpress hosted on a digital ocean droplet. There is quite a lot of maintenance in keeping all components updated and reasonably secure, installing SSL certificates, managing a database and backups.
