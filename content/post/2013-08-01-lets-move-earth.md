... away from the sun.

I believe that there is a real risk/possibility that at some point humans will attempt some form of geo-engineering to deal with climate change.

One sci-fi idea I have been thinking of concerns moving Earth away from the Sun to reduce the solar constant. I have been wanting to use this idea in teaching as a fun student project. Note: This is not a serious proposal, but just a thought experiment. Other people have thought of this (see links below.)

_**Q: What would it take to reduce the solar constant by 1% by moving Earth?**_

(1% is about 4 times the forcing needed to 'balance' 4xCO2. See table 2, [Kravitz et al. 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrd.50646/pdf).)

The basic idea is to transfer momentum using gravity assist maneuvers. The way it works is the same idea that was used to [sling-shot the Voyager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) probes far away from Earth. In this way it would be possible to transfer momentum from a close passing object to the Earth.

One idea would be to farm Asteroids with slight nudges far away from Earth in order to harvest some of their momentum. I did a back of envelope calculation that shows it would be hard to do this.

Other ideas have been proposed:

  * [Nasa aims to move Earth](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/jun/10/globalwarming.climatechange)
  * [Birch, 1993, How to move a planet](http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/MoveAPlanet.pdf)
  * A google scholar search for [Terraforming venus](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=terraforming%20venus).
  * Beech 2009: Terraforming. book (freely available [here](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-09796-1/page/1))

**Back of the envelope:**

(_Note this is a careless BoE calculation. It has not been double checked - it might very well be wrong. If so then please let me know_)

Here's a back of the envelope calculation of what would be required to reduce the solar constant by 1%. This would correspond to [~0.5% increase in the distance to the sun](http://c21.phas.ubc.ca/article/simple-earth-climate-model-additional-concept-explanations), which in turn would correspond to a [0.25%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit#Velocity) increase in the velocity of Earth.

Definitions:

U=velocity of Earth

Ma="Asteroid" mass

Me=Earth mass

The [maximum momentum transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) we can get from one sling-shot would be: 2_U_M<sub>a</sub>. That gives a velocity change of 2_U_M<sub>a</sub>/M<sub>E</sub>. So to get 0.25% velocity change then we would need to use many asteroid passes with a combined mass of ~M<sub>E</sub>/80. better calculations can be found [here](http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1002790227314.pdf).

Notes on 0.5% and 0.25%:

The (solar constant) amount of radiation received at Earth is proportional to the area of disc with the one Earth radius relative to the area of the sphere with a radius equal to the Sun-Earth distance (rSE). See [diagram here](http://c21.phas.ubc.ca/article/simple-earth-climate-model-additional-concept-explanations). I.e. the solar constant scales with 1/r<sub>SE</sub><sup>2</sup>. Thus a 1.005 increase in r<sub>SE </sub>corresponds to a 1% decrease in the amount received.

The relationship between orbit radius and velocity can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit#Velocity) and velocity scales with 1/sqrt(r<sub>SE</sub>). This gives me the 0.25% velocity change.
