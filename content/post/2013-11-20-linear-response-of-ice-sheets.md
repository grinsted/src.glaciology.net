Bamber & Aspinall 2012 made an expert elicitation of ice sheet experts. They shows this table in their [supplementary information](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n4/extref/nclimate1778-s1.pdf):

This table shows that on average then most experts expect that ice sheet loss more than doubles when you double warming. Semi empirical models ([SEMs](/Home/PDFs/Announcements/gslprojection)) generally assume linearity. Arguably this suggests that SEMs may be overly conservative.Â However, ice sheet modelling supports the linearity assumption in SEMs (e.g. [Bindschadler et al. 2012](http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/images/1/1a/12J125R_final.pdf)).
  
More discussion of linearity between sea level rise and climate forcing can be found [here](/Home/Miscellaneous-Debris/icesheetsandsemi-empiricalmodel) and [here](/Home/Miscellaneous-Debris/threeviewsonsealevelcommitment).
  
Another very interesting plot from Fettweis showing a strong relationship between Greenland surface mass balance from an RCM and global warming in the encapsulating GCM.
