Attached isÂ a [pdf](/Home/Miscellaneous-Debris/bayesianexercisesforinverseproblems/Exercises%201%20for%20Inverse%20Problems.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1) with some exercises for that i have used use in my course on inverse problems.
  
Problem 0: Goal understand why it is attractive to use loglikelihoods over likelihoods.
  
Problem 1: An exact model with a single model parameter. This makes easy to plot.
  
Problem 2: A variant of problem 1 with an inexact model.
  
Problem 3: Goal: Show that it is easier to calculate derived quantities such as "expected value" of the posterior when you use mcmc.
  
Problem 4: A problem where it is easy to understand why is the likelihood called a likelihood.
  
Problem 5: A problem where you have to grasp many concepts.
  
Exercises 4 & 5 are probably the most fun.
