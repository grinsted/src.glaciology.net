A new paper is out in [AJCC](http://www.scirp.org/journal/ajcc/) which finds a long-term increase of cyclones of the [Mascarene Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascarene_Islands) based on historical records ([Garnier andÂ ](goog_1440306791)[Desarthe, 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/ajcc.2013.21001)).

It looks pretty dramatic, While there are caveats with this type of data (see paper). I believe it is clear that there is a real trend in this data.

I have looked at [hurricane surge records]({{< ref "publication/2013-10-11-homogeneous-record-of-atlantic-hurricane-surge-threat-since-1923.md" >}}) from the atlantic. It would be fun to look at long records from the indian ocean as well.
