This a quick look at a run from the CMIP5 archive from a model with low sensitivity.

{{< youtube cgTOwVerp8o >}}

It shows pentadal averages of temperature from 1850-2100 relative to a 1980-2000 baseline.

red: warmer than present

blue: colder than present

It is a run from the INMCM4 model from the Institute of Mathematical Modelling (russia). I need it for some statistical modelling I have going on.


(Sorry about it taking so long. I should have made it alot faster. This version has one frame per month and 25fps.)

The sound track is _Hope for a Better Day_ by me, which you can download [here](http://www.glaciology.net/music).
