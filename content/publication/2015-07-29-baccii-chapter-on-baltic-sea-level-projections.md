Global warming is causing sea levels to rise, primarily due to loss of land-based ice masses and thermal (steric) expansion of the world oceans. Sea level does not rise in a globally uniform manner, but varies in complex spatial patterns. This chapter reviews projections of the individual contributions to sea-level rise. These are used to assemble a mid-range scenario of a 0.70 ± 0.30-m sea-level rise over the twenty-first century (based on the SRES A1B scenario) and a high-end scenario of 1.10 m. <!--more--> The sea-level projection was regionalised to the Baltic Sea area by taking into account local dynamic sea-level rise and weighting the components of the sea-level budget by their static equilibrium fingerprint. This yields a mid-range Baltic Sea sea-level rise that is ~80 % of the global mean. Ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) partly compensates for local sea-level rise in much of the region. For the mid-range scenario, this equates to a twenty-first century relative sea-level rise of 0.60 m near Hamburg and a relative sea-level fall of 0.35 m in the Bothnian Bay. The high-end scenario is characterised by an additional 0.5 m.

Note: This chapter has been superceded by newer probabilistic sea level projections using AR5 as the foundation. Please refer to [this paper](/Home/PDFs/Announcements/sealevelriseprojectionsfornortherneuropeunderrcp85) for more up to date information.
