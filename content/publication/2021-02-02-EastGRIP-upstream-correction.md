The EastGRIP ice core is located in an ice-stream on the eastern flank of the Greenland ice-sheet. Deeper and older ice in the ice core will have originated upstream from the drill site. In this paper, we look into the upstream effects on the ice core.

## Abstract
The Northeast Greenland Ice-Stream (NEGIS) is the largest active ice-stream on the Greenland ice-sheet and a crucial
contributor to the ice-sheet mass balance. To investigate the ice-stream dynamics and to gain information about the past
climate, a deep ice-core is drilled in the upstream part of the NEGIS, termed the East Greenland ice-core project (EastGRIP).
Upstream flow effects introduce non-climatic bias in ice-cores and are particularly strong at EastGRIP due to high ice-flow
velocities and the location in an ice-stream on the eastern flank of the Greenland ice-sheet. Understanding and ultimately
correcting for such effects requires information on the source area and the local atmospheric conditions at the time of ice deposition.
We use a two-dimensional Dansgaardâ€“Johnsen model to simulate ice-flow along three approximated flow-lines between
the summit of the ice-sheet and EastGRIP. Model parameters are determined using a Monte Carlo inversion by minimizing the
misfit between modeled isochrones and isochrones observed in radio-echo-sounding (RES) images. We calculate backward10
in-time particle trajectories to determine the source area of ice found in the EastGRIP core today and present estimates of
surface elevation and past accumulation-rates at the deposition site. Our results indicate that increased accumulation in the
upstream area is predominantly responsible for the constant annual layer thickness observed in the upper part of the ice column
at EastGRIP. Inverted model parameters suggest that the imprint of basal melting and sliding is present in large parts along the
flow profiles and that most internal ice deformation happens close to the bedrock. The results of this study can act as a basis
for applying upstream corrections to a variety of ice-core measurements, and the model parameters can be useful constraints
for more sophisticated modeling approaches in the future.
