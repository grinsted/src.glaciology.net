**Abstract** 
  
I asses the feasibility of multi-variate scaling relationships to estimate glacier volume from glacier inventory data. Scaling laws are calibrated against volume observations optimized for the specific purpose of estimating total global glacier ice volume. I find that adjustments for continentality and elevation range improve skill of area-volume scaling. These scaling relationships are applied to each record in the Randolph Glacier Inventory which is the first globally complete inventory of glaciers and ice caps. I estimate that the total volume of all glaciers in the world is 0.35±0.07 m sea level equivalent, including ice sheet peripheral glaciers. This is substantially less than a recent state-of-the-art estimate. Area volume scaling bias issues for large ice masses, and incomplete inventory data are offered as [explanations for the difference](/Home/Miscellaneous-Debris/estimatingglobalglaciervolume).

More details on the study can be found [under this link](/Home/Miscellaneous-Debris/estimatingglobalglaciervolume) where I discuss:

  * Comparisons to Radic and Hock 2010, and Huss & Farinotti 2012.
  * Area-volume scaling and glacier slope.
  * Physical vs. statistical estimates of glacier volume.
  * Area-Volume scaling, -controversial?

#### Thoughts on my experience with the open discussion format

This is my first open discussion paper, and I think it was an excellent choice for this manuscript. It is also my first solo paper and the comments from the referees were therefore especially welcome. (Thank you anon.referee#1, R. Braithwaite, and M.Huss for comments that spurred great improvement over the discussion paper).

This figure shows that ~85% of the global glacier volume is stored in~1000 largest RGI glacier complexes (>100 km2). In the paper I suggest that we can improve the glacier estimate through detailed studies of those complexes.
