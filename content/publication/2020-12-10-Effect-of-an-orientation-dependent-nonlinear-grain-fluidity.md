We investigated how the orientation-dependent nonlinear fluidity
of a transversely isotropic grain rheology can influence the
directional enhancement-factors of a polycrystal by assuming
a homogeneous stress field. For polycrystals
with intermediate-to-strong orientation fabrics, we find that the
soft-to-hard shear-enhancement ratio of axisymmetric
polycrystals can be at least 10 times larger compared to
if the fluidity is assumed orientation independent, while
the compressional/extensional enhancement along the fabric
symmetry direction can be at least 10 times smaller.

## Abstract
Bulk directional enhancement-factors are derived from a transversely isotropic grain
rheology in the case of orientation-dependent and orientation-independent nonlinear grain fluidities,
assuming stress homogenization over the polycrystal scale. By considering evolving single-maximum and
girdle fabrics, we find that bulk (polycrystalline) rheologies relying on a transversely isotropic grain
rheology with an orientation-independent fluidity might underestimate bulk strain-rate enhancements for
intermediate-to-strong fabrics of up to a factor of ten. Hence, our work hence extends previous results
based on simple basal-slip (Schmid) models to the transversely isotropic rheology, particularly relevant
for large-scale anisotropic ice-flow modelling. In order to derive bulk enhancement-factors for arbitrary
fabrics, we expand the c-axis distribution in terms of a spherical harmonic series, which allows the
rheology-required structure tensors through order eight to easily be calculated. This new non-parametric
spectral fabric model thus provides an alternative to current structure-tensor-based modelling.
